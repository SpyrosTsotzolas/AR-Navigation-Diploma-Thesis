    <string name="app_info">This app is created as a demostration
        showing the power of Beacon technology and Augmented Reality.
        \n\nThis app provides a tested and fully functional navigation
        in AR inside my department at University of Ioannina.</string>

    <string name="guides_for_app" tools:ignore="StringEscaping">1.When the user launches the app, they will be prompted
        to select their position from a predefined list. The list consists of all rooms in the space, where the appication
        will be tested.\n\n2.Alternatively, the user can scan the QR code used to download the app. This is needed to immediately set their
        position in the virtual world. Using such QR code is the most convenient way to ensure
        the accuracy of the user position.\n\n3.After the initial position is set, the app
        starts the ARsesion. Now the app and its minimap will react to user movements
        seamlessly using visual-inertial odometry provided by ARCore.\n\n4.The user can choose
        a destination point from a predefined menu or enter it manually. The app searches
        for a vertex with the given ID and marks it as a destination point.\n\n5.The navigation
        path from the user current location to the destination point will be calculated in
        real-time and displayed as a spline with animated arrows.</string>
