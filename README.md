_Thesis:_ 
> Development of an Augmented Reality application for indoor navigation using Arcore and Sceneform
# Introduction
The purpose of this thesis is the development of a fully functional application for Android mobile devices using Augmented Reality technology. The application is designed for students of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering to facilitate them to navigate quickly and easily inside the building, without having to look for information about the destination that they might find interesting. Augmented Reality lies in the fact that the application points with objects (arrow, man guiding) where the user is headed inside the building to reach his destination. The technologies that  were used for the implementation of this thesis are Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE), using the Java programming language, the ARCore SDK for the integration of Augmented Reality, as well as the beacon technology for updating the user's position in the space.
